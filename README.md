# End-to-End AI-Powered Algorithmic Trading Framework

This project is a sophisticated, fully autonomous Python framework for developing, backtesting, and deploying machine learning-based trading strategies. Its core feature is the integration of a Large LanguageModel (LLM) as a dynamic "AI Strategist" that actively manages the entire trading process, from initial setup to cycle-over-cycle adaptation and failure recovery.

The framework is built around a robust walk-forward engine, ensuring that strategies are tested out-of-sample in a manner that closely simulates live trading conditions. It is designed for resilience, adaptability, and continuous learning.

## ü§ñ Key Features

* **LLM-Powered Strategy**: Utilizes Google's Gemini models to make high-level strategic decisions, replacing hard-coded logic with dynamic, context-aware reasoning.
* **‚ôüÔ∏è "Chess Player" Forecasting**: The AI performs a "pre-mortem" analysis at the start of each run, anticipating likely failure modes and pre-defining contingency plans for more intelligent failure recovery.
* **üìà Walk-Forward Engine**: Employs a rigorous walk-forward methodology, training the model on a sliding window of historical data and testing it on the subsequent unseen period, providing a more realistic performance assessment.
* **üß† Persistent Memory**: The framework learns from its own history. It maintains a "long-term memory" of all past runs and a "champion" model, allowing the AI to compare new results against historical successes and failures.
* **üìö Dynamic Strategy Playbook**: Strategies are not hard-coded. They are defined in an external `strategy_playbook.json` file, allowing users to add, remove, or "retire" strategies and their feature sets without touching the core codebase.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Feature Engineering**: Automatically creates a rich feature stack from multi-timeframe data, including technical indicators (RSI, ADX, Bollinger Bands), candle microstructure, indicator dynamics (slope), and fractional differentiation.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Robust Risk Management**: Implements multiple layers of safety, including a per-cycle drawdown "circuit breaker," tiered risk configuration based on equity, anomaly detection using Isolation Forests, and confidence-based trade sizing.

## How It Works: The Core Loop

The framework operates in a continuous loop, simulating a real-world adaptive trading system.

1.  **Initial Setup**: The AI Strategist analyzes the overall market data, long-term framework memory, and its own past notes to select an optimal strategy, a targeted feature set, and key parameters for the entire run.
2.  **Strategic Forecast**: Immediately after setup, the AI creates a "game plan." It identifies the most likely reasons its chosen strategy might fail and defines Contingency Paths B (an alternative strategy) and C (a parameter tweak) in advance.
3.  **Walk-Forward Cycle Begins**: The framework divides the data into sequential training and testing periods.
    * **Training**: An XGBoost model is trained on the current historical data window. Hyperparameters are optimized using Optuna.
    * **Label Quality Check**: Ensures that the data from the training period is suitable for creating a predictive model, preventing wasted cycles on "un-trainable" market conditions.
    * **Testing**: The newly trained model is used to "trade" the next out-of-sample data period.
4.  **Performance Analysis & Adaptation**: At the end of the testing cycle, the AI analyzes the performance.
    * **If Successful**: It suggests incremental improvements for the next cycle.
    * **If Failed (Circuit Breaker / Poor Training)**: It is reminded of its pre-run forecast and must choose whether to execute one of its planned contingencies or devise a new path based on the new data.
5.  **Memory Update**: The results of the run are saved to the `historical_runs.jsonl` log. If the run's performance (measured by the MAR ratio) is better than any previous run, it's saved as the new `champion.json`.
6.  **Repeat**: The process repeats until all data has been backtested.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* A Google Gemini API Key.
* Required libraries. You will need to install the following:

    ```
    numpy
    pandas
    xgboost
    optuna
    scikit-learn
    pydantic
    python-dotenv
    requests
    matplotlib
    shap
    # For optional GNN features:
    # torch
    # torch_geometric
    ```
    You can typically install these via pip: `pip install numpy pandas xgboost ...`

### 2. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Gemini API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 3. Data Preparation
Place your historical data files (`.csv` or `.txt`) in the root directory. The framework relies on a specific naming convention to identify the asset and timeframe:

* **Format**: `SYMBOL_TIMEFRAME.csv` (e.g., `EURUSD_H1.csv`, `BTCUSD_M15.txt`)
* **Columns**: The file should contain standard OHLC data. The script will automatically detect columns named `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Date`, `Time`, and `Volume`/`Tickvol`.

### 4. Running the Framework
Execute the script from your terminal:
```bash
python End_To_End_Advanced_ML_Trading_Framework_PRO_V192_Linux.py
```
The script can be configured to run once or in a continuous "daemon" mode for ongoing research by adjusting the `CONTINUOUS_RUN_HOURS` and `MAX_RUNS` variables in the `main()` function.

## Framework Output

The script generates several important files inside a `Results/` directory:

* **Run-Specific Folder**: A unique folder is created for each run (e.g., `Andromeda_V192/`) containing:
    * `_report.txt`: A detailed text-based performance report.
    * `_equity_curve.png`: A plot of the walk-forward equity curve.
    * `_shap_summary.png`: A feature importance plot from the aggregated SHAP values.
    * `_model.json`: The final trained XGBoost model from the last cycle.
    * `_run.log`: A detailed log of the entire run.
* **`champion.json`**: A JSON file containing the configuration and final metrics of the best-performing run to date (highest MAR ratio).
* **`historical_runs.jsonl`**: A log file where each line is a JSON object summarizing a completed run. This serves as the framework's long-term memory.
* **`strategy_playbook.json`**: A dynamic JSON file defining the available strategies, their descriptions, and default feature sets.
* **`nickname_ledger.json`**: Stores the AI-generated codenames for each script version.


### Data File Requirements

To load custom data into the framework, users must adhere to specific requirements regarding file location, naming, and content format.

#### **File Location**
* The data files, either `.csv` or `.txt`, must be placed in the root directory of the project.

#### **File Naming Convention**
The framework relies on a strict naming convention to automatically identify the financial instrument (symbol) and the chart timeframe.
* **Format**: The filename must be in the format `SYMBOL_TIMEFRAME.csv` or `SYMBOL_TIMEFRAME.txt`.
* **Examples**:
    * `EURUSD_H1.csv` for Euro vs US Dollar on the 1-hour chart.
    * `BTCUSD_M15.txt` for Bitcoin vs US Dollar on the 15-minute chart.

#### **File Content and Columns**
The file should contain standard OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data. The script is designed to be flexible and automatically detects the necessary columns.

* **Delimiter**: The script can automatically handle comma-separated (`.csv`) and tab-separated (`.txt`) files.
* **Column Names**: Column headers are case-insensitive. For example, `open`, `Open`, and `OPEN` are all treated the same.
* **Required Columns**:
    * **Price Data**: Columns for `Open`, `High`, `Low`, and `Close` must be present.
    * **Timestamp**: The script needs date and time information, which can be provided in one of two ways:
        1.  A single column containing both date and time.
        2.  Two separate columns, one for `Date` and one for `Time`.
* **Optional Columns**:
    * **Volume**: A column for trade volume can be included under the name `Volume` or `Tickvol`. If no volume column is found, it is treated as zero.
